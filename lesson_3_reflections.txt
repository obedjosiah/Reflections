When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
My Thoughts: A remote repository comes in handy when you need to share your work with others. It makes collaboration easy.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
My Thoughts: Pulling changes manually is more advantageous in that contributions may be made to your work from other sources and you will probaby not want those changes to be updated to your primary working files automatically before you have vetted them. This manual features helps you check what changes to accept and to discard.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
My Thoughts: A Fork is a repository that is cloned from a GitHub account to another GitHub account. It is used when you want to work with a repository from another GitHub user and still maintain reference to the original repo. 
A Clone is a repo that has been dupliacted from a repo either from GitHub or from another local repo. They are necessarywhen you want to get a repo to your local platform to work with.
A branch is simply a group of commits placed within a container/label. A branch shares a lot of similaririties with a commit; a branch's history can be checked, the difference between two branches can be checked, etc. It is necssary to help in compartmentalization of your work.
